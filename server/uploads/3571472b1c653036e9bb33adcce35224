Physical Media in Computer Networks
Introduction
A physical medium is the pathway through which bits travel between a transmitter and receiver in a network. As a bit moves from one end system to another, it passes through multiple transmitter-receiver pairs, each using electromagnetic waves or optical pulses propagated across a physical medium. Physical media can vary along the path and fall into two categories:

Guided Media: Waves are guided along solid media (e.g., fiber-optic cable, twisted-pair copper wire, coaxial cable).

Unguided Media: Waves propagate through the atmosphere or outer space (e.g., wireless LAN, satellite channels).

The cost of physical links (e.g., copper, fiber) is often minor compared to installation labor. To save future expenses, many buildings install multiple media types (twisted pair, fiber, coaxial) during construction.

Guided Media
1. Twisted-Pair Copper Wire
Physical Properties: Two insulated 1 mm-thick copper wires twisted in a spiral pattern to reduce interference. Bundled pairs are shielded for protection.

Cost: Least expensive guided medium.

Capacity:

LANs: 10 Mbps to 10 Gbps (e.g., Category 6a supports 10 Gbps up to 100 m).

Residential Internet: Dial-up (56 kbps), DSL (tens of Mbps).

Distance: Up to 100 m (high-speed LANs); DSL performance degrades with distance from the ISP’s central office.

Propagation Delay: Low (speed of light in copper ≈ 2.3 × 10⁸ m/s).

Transmission Delay: Depends on data rate (e.g., 1 Gbps = 1 ns/bit).

Network Devices: Switches, repeaters, or DSLAMs (for DSL) strengthen signals.

2. Coaxial Cable
Physical Properties: Two concentric copper conductors with insulation/shielding for high data rates.

Cost: Moderate; widely used in cable TV/Internet systems.

Capacity: Hundreds of Mbps (shared medium in cable Internet).

Distance: Longer than twisted pair due to shielding; exact range depends on signal frequency.

Propagation/Transmission Delay: Similar to twisted pair but with higher bandwidth.

Network Devices: Cable modems, amplifiers.

3. Fiber Optics
Physical Properties: Thin, flexible glass/plastic fibers carrying light pulses (1 pulse = 1 bit).

Cost: High (due to optical transmitters/receivers); cheaper for long-haul than short-distance.

Capacity: Tens to hundreds of Gbps (OC standards: OC-1 to OC-768, ranging from 51.8 Mbps to 39.8 Gbps).

Distance: Up to 100 km without repeaters (low attenuation).

Propagation Delay: Lowest (speed of light in fiber ≈ 2 × 10⁸ m/s).

Transmission Delay: Minimal (e.g., 10 Gbps = 0.1 ns/bit).

Network Devices: Optical switches, repeaters.

Advantages: Immune to EMI, hard to tap, ideal for Internet backbones and overseas links.

Unguided Media
1. Terrestrial Radio Channels
Physical Properties: Electromagnetic waves; no physical wiring required.

Types:

Short-distance: 1–2 m (e.g., wireless keyboards).

Local-area: 10–100s of m (e.g., Wi-Fi).

Wide-area: 10s of km (e.g., cellular).

Capacity: Varies by environment (Wi-Fi: 100s of Mbps; cellular: 10s of Mbps).

Challenges: Path loss, shadow fading, multipath fading, interference.

Propagation Delay: Speed of light (~3 × 10⁸ m/s), but delays occur due to obstacles.

Network Devices: Routers, antennas, base stations.

2. Satellite Radio Channels
Types:

Geostationary Satellites: 36,000 km above Earth; 280 ms propagation delay; speeds up to 100s of Mbps.

LEO Satellites: Lower orbit; require constellations for coverage; potential for future Internet access.

Capacity: Hundreds of Mbps.

Distance: Global coverage (geostationary); LEOs reduce delay but need multiple satellites.

Propagation Delay: High (geostationary: 280 ms round-trip).

Network Devices: Ground stations, transponders (repeaters).
